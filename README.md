This repository contains a project aimed at predicting and managing stress levels through the use of wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms. The project investigates the possibility of developing accurate stress prediction models using physiological data collected from wearable devices. The report describes the project's methodology, findings, advantages, disadvantages, and conclusions.The project's main discovery is that machine learning algorithms and wearable devices can be used effectively to detect and analyse stress levels. The report emphasises the importance of respiration and heart rate variability in stress prediction.
It presents a comprehensive work model that includes data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and real-time stress monitoring via wearable devices. NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow are among the Python libraries used at various stages of the process.Continuous physiological data monitoring via wearable devices is emphasised as an important aspect of stress prediction. The report goes into detail about the steps involved in collecting data, preprocessing it, and extracting features from wearable devices.
The methodology is discussed in detail in the discussion section, which includes feature extraction, model training, data collection, and model evaluation. The accuracy and personalised nature of stress management strategies derived from the model are emphasised.The project discusses the benefits of personalised stress management strategies, cost-effectiveness, accurate prediction, early detection, and continuous monitoring via wearable devices. It also discusses limitations such as data generalisation, privacy concerns, and the need for technical expertise.Finally, the project shows how machine learning algorithms and wearable sensors can be used to predict and manage stress. The importance of continuous monitoring and the ability to provide personalised stress management strategies is emphasised in the report.
